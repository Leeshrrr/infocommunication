                        in iDV<sup>x</sup> Lab ( <a id="official-side" href="https://idvxlab.com/" target="_blank">idvxlab.com</a> ), 
                        Tongji University, 2020. The goal of the workshop was to evaluate 
                        the effectiveness of our design space, which systematically describes design 
                        patterns in data videos. The design space combines a dimension for animation 
                        techniques that are frequently used to facilitate data communication with one 
                        for visual narrative strategies served by such animation techniques to support 
                        story presentation.

                        To explore the use of the design patterns of BTFW interaction, we conducted a user study with 109 participants.

                    <p class="about-para-text">
                        Based on the findings from our preliminary study, we measure the design patterns from four aspects, including <i>self-story connection, user engagement, information recall</i>, and <i>the balance between interactivity and comprehensibility</i>. To measure self-story connection, we referred to the instrument used to assess self-brand connection in the field of marketing [1]. We believe it is an appropriate instrument as both self-story and self-brand connection focus on incorporating the narrative into people's self-concepts. We modified the questions proposed by [1] to fit the context of data stories. For example, "Brand X reflects who I am" was rewritten as "This story reflects who I am". As a result, four items related self-story connection were used in our questionnaire, including <i>reflection, connection, identification</i>, and <i>match</i>. In terms of user engagement, we followed the methodology used in [2] that assesses engagement from the perspective of data-driven storytelling. Specifically, seven items related to user engagement were used in our questionnaire, including <i>focused attention, enjoyment, interest, felt involvement, challenge, motivation</i>, and <i>likability</i>. In our questionnaire, items for both self-story connection and user engagement use a 7-point Likert scale (1 denotes "totally disagree", 7 denotes "totally agree"). Information recall was measured by conducting online interviews with the participants two weeks after the user study. They were required to describe what they remembered about the stories they had read. Besides, to measure the balance between interactivity and comprehensibility, we instructed the participants to rate the interactivity and comprehensibility of a data story on a grid following the methodology proposed by  Lan et al. [3]. In the grid, the X-axis represents the scale of interactivity while the Y-axis represents the scale of comprehensibility, both of them ranging from -3 to 3.

                        To perform statistical analysis on the results of our user study, we first conducted Shapiro-Wilk tests and found that the quantitative data was not normally distributed. Thus, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests was used to compare the baseline story (<b>C0</b>) with interactive stories (<b>C1</b>-<b>C6</b>) as a group and Kruskal-Wallis H tests was used for the mutual comparison among <b>C1</b>-<b>C6</b>.

                    <p class="about-para-text">
                        The result of Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test showed that stories with BTFW interaction showed significantly higher scores than the baseline story in self-story connection. By looking at the four indicators of self-story connection separately, stories with BTFW interaction earned significantly higher scores in all of them, including reflection (z = -5.606, p < .001), connection (z = -2.934, p = .003), identification (z = -3.521, p < .001), and match (z = -2.928, p = .003). This result was in line with what we found in the interviews that most participants agreed BTFW interaction promoted them to build connections to the stories (e.g., "this is like a process of purification, filtering out the narrative that has nothing to do with me" (P18)).Then, to examine the difference in self-story connection among the six patterns, we performed a Kruskal-Wallis H test. According to the result, the six design patterns were significantly different in reflection (H(5) = 22.641, p < .00), connection (H(5) = 12.284, p = .031), and identification (H(5) = 12.696, p = .026). Dunn’s post hoc tests suggested that C1 had the highest scores of reflection, connection, and identification (see Figure 1). Specifically, for reflection, C1 was significantly higher than C3 (p = .001) and C4 (p = .001); for connection, C1 was significantly higher than C3 (p =.023); for identification, C1 earned a significantly higher score than C4 (p =.026).The reason may be that the sense of connection produced at the beginning would keep staying with the participants throughout the whole story (e.g., "when I realized the following content was set to explain my personalized beginning, I felt it became more relevant to me" (P7)).

                        According to the result of Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, C1-C6 showed significantly higher scores than C0 in engagement for all the seven indicators. Specifically, the seven indicators include focused attention (z = -4.929, p < .001), enjoyment (z = -4.000, p < .001), interest (z = -4.454, p < .001), felt involvement (z = -5.403, p < .001), challenge (z = -3.492, p < .001), motivation (z = -4.344, p < .001) and likability (z = -4.028, p < .001). Qualitative feedback showed that many participants attributed their deeper engagement to the stronger self-story connection (e.g., "when the story was specifically told to me, I would read it more carefully" (P23)). Then we conducted a Kruskal-Wallis H test to compare the six patterns mutually in terms of engagement. Results showed there were no significant differences between the six patterns. As shown in Figure 1, among these patterns, C1 showed the highest mean in interest (M = 5.89), felt involvement (M = 5.62), and likability (M = 5.43), C2 showed the highest mean in challenge (M = 5.56), and C5 earned the highest mean in focused attention (M = 5.83), enjoyment (M = 5.42), and motivation (M = 5.61). The reasons for high engagement ratings were diverse in the interviews. Some of them explained it was because of enjoyment (e.g., "I was surprised that I got seven questions right, and I was happy about that" (P4)), others mentioned focused attention (e.g., "I devoted a lot of attention in C1 to finding myself in the vaccine line" (P10)) and motivation (e.g., "reading C5 is like being in a competition, I was eager to guess next question" (P2)).

                    <p class="about-para-text">
                        The results of the balance between interactivity and comprehensibility are shown in Figure 2. In terms of interactivity (X-axes in the grids), interactive stories earned significantly higher scores than the baseline (z = -8.488, p < .001). The Kruskal-Wallis H test confirmed that there were no significant differences among the six patterns (H(5) = 51.190, p = .163) in interactivity. While C6 earned the highest score (M = 2.04), C2 (M = 1.55) and C4 (M = 1.49) were thought relatively low interactive. In the interviews, some participants mentioned they rate the interactivity according to the frequency of interaction during their reading (e.g., "most part of C6 is constituted by interactions" (P24)), others explained that they scored based on the freedom of their actions (e.g., "with the three sliders provided by C3, I can create countless ways to input" (P1)). For comprehensibility (Y-axes in the grids), there was no significant difference between interactive stories and the baseline (z = -1.919, p = .055). Besides, the six patterns also showed no significant mutual difference in comprehensibility (H(5) = 2.894, p = .716). While C1 earned the highest score (M = 2.04), C1-C5 were all thought more comprehensible than the baseline (M = 1.82), only C6 showed the lowest comprehensibility (M = 1.66). Some participants explained that they gave C6 a low score in comprehensibility due to the lack of expounds from authors (e.g., "I had expected the author to tell me the reason for the prices changing, however, he explained nothing and ended the story hastily after I did all the questions" (P2)).
